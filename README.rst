Pit (Mango)
================================

**Pit** is the standard library of the `Mango programming language`_.

The Mango language itself is not finished, so there is no standard library yet. Have a look at the compiler_!

The name "pit" is based on the hard center of a Mango, which is called "pit" (although "seed" is more common).
